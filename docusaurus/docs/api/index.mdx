To get started with the Fluid Framework, you'll want to take a dependency on our client library, [fluid-framework](./fluid-framework.md).

You'll then want to pair that with the appropriate service client implementation based on your service.
These include:
- [@fluidframework/azure-client](./azure-client.md) (for use with [Azure Fluid Relay](../deployment/azure-frs))
- [@fluidframework/odsp-client](./odsp-client.md) (for use with [SharePoint Embedded](../deployment/sharepoint-embedded))

For more information on our service client implementations, see [Fluid Services](../deployment).
