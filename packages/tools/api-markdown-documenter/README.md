# @@fluid-tools/api-markdown-documenter

Contains a programatic API for generating {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown | Markdown} documentation from an API report generated by {@link https://api-extractor.com/ | API-Extractor}.

It is akin to {@link https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/tree/main/apps/api-documenter | API-Documenter} and is heavily based upon it and uses it under the hood, but is designed to be more extensible and can be used programatically.

## Installation

To get started, install the package by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @fluid-tools/api-markdown-documenter -D
```

## Usage

This package contains 2 primary, programmatic entry-points:

### renderDocuments

The `renderDocuments` function accepts an [ApiModel](https://api.rushstack.io/pages/api-extractor-model.apimodel/) representing the package(s) of a repository, and generates a sequence of "Document" objects representing the resulting documentation based on the other provided policy options.
These objects include information about the page item, its documentation contents, and the intended output file path the document file should be rendered to, based on provided policy options.

The input `ApiModel` here will generally be the output of `API-Extractor`.

### renderFiles

The `renderFiles` function operates like [renderDocuments](#renderdocuments), but actually writes the resulting documents to disk as files based on the provided policy options.
This function also accepts a `MarkdownEmitter` object that does the conversion from `DocNode` trees to a Markdown stream that will ultimately be rendered to file.

## Upcoming Work

-   Config option for "Model" page title
-   DocList
-   Injext IDs for remaining headings
-   Dynamic "Modifiers" column in tables
-   Pre-canned policies (flat, index, adjacency)

### Styling improvements

-   Specially denote optional parameters / properties
-   Better `@defaultValue` rendering.

## Longer-term work

-   Replace DocNode output / MarkdownEmitter with Markdown AST trees and simple interface for rendering those trees to a stream
-   Handle multiple package entrypoints
