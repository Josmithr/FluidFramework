# includeTopLevelDocumentHeading

Whether or not to include a top-level heading in rendered document pages.

## Remarks

If you will be rendering the document contents into some other document content that will inject its own root heading, this can be used to omit that heading from what is rendered by this system.

## Signature

```typescript
includeTopLevelDocumentHeading?: boolean;
```
