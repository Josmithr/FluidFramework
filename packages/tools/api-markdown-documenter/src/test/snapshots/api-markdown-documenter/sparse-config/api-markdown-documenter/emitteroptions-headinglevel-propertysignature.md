# headingLevel

Contextual heading level. Will automatically increment based on `Section` items encountered such that heading levels can be increased automatically based on content hierarchy.

## Remarks

When invoking the Emitter externally, this should be set to 0 to represent having not entered any `Section`<!-- -->s yet.

## Signature

```typescript
headingLevel?: number;
```
