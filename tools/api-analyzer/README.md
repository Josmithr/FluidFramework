# api-analyzer

This private ECMAScript module (ESM) package provides an experimental, reusable analysis session.
It uses the official native TypeScript 7 API and includes the Stage 0 compiler capability tests.
Its API is not stable. It does not generate production artifacts or replace API Extractor.
Publication remains a separate decision.

## Development contract

Follow the [implementation plan](../plans/api-extractor-replacement-implementation-plan.md), including documentation-driven development, test-driven development, and functional architecture.
Write behavior contracts before implementation and run focused failing tests before adding or fixing behavior.
Write documentation in Simplified Technical English and follow the [repository documentation guidelines](../../docs/content/Guidelines/Documentation-Guidelines.md).
Keep compiler communication and process lifecycle separate from pure transformations.
Do not add a custom type checker, use compiler-private APIs, or switch backends to make a capability test pass.

## Stage 0 contract

Pin the analysis engine to TypeScript 7.0.2.
Build the same fixture with TypeScript 6.0.3 and 7.0.2, then analyze both sets of untrimmed declarations with TS7.
Use the official client and the installed native executable.
Keep generated fixture files in temporary directories and remove them after each test.

The capability tests must check:

- Exported aliases retain their public names and target identities; type-only paths remain distinguishable.
- Generic inherited members use their effective types. Ordinary intersections and `Pick`, `Omit`, and `Readonly` preserve member selection and modifiers.
- Documentation and callable overload information remain available after declaration emit.
- A retained connection and snapshot support repeated output-like queries without a new analysis setup. Record the limits of any reuse evidence.
- Normal disposal and native-process failure terminate promptly and do not leave owned processes running.
- Public APIs needed for complete and release-filtered declarations are available and produce consumable output, or an explicit capability failure is recorded.

Compiler capability failures are investigation results, not permissions to lower requirements.
Do not close F1-F4 or B1-B6 based only on these small fixtures.
Full artifact, cross-package, and migration tests belong to later stages.

## Stage 1 contract

Stage 1 implements an experimental synchronous analysis session, not a stable public package API.
Run the full declaration-input capability suite through the synchronous TS7 client before relying on it.
Retain the separate async crash reproduction and declaration-emission investigation gates.

Resolve programmatic configuration with ordered base configurations and explicit overrides.
Use `@eslint/object-schema` to validate property types and merge the ordered layers.
Use the last supplied scalar value, replace supplied arrays, and merge rule settings by rule name.
Treat `null` and `undefined` property values as omitted.
Reject inheritance cycles, missing required settings, and duplicate entrypoint names with structured diagnostics.
Return readonly effective configuration without mutating the supplied configuration objects.
Resolve relative paths from the working directory supplied by the caller, not from the process working directory.

An analysis session owns its compiler connection and cached API facts.
These facts are detached: they contain no compiler objects and remain usable after the compiler snapshot is disposed.
Repeated requests for unchanged inputs reuse the same facts.
Task order and changes to rule settings do not affect reuse.
Explicit invalidation discards cached facts and compiler state before the next request.
Callers must invalidate after relevant changes to inputs or module resolution settings.
Automatic file watching and persistent caching are not part of this stage.
Repeated close calls have no effect. Requests after close fail with a diagnostic that explains how to recover.
An unexpected adapter failure clears owned state and closes the session.
The original error is rethrown. If cleanup also fails, an `AggregateError` retains both errors.
Later requests must not return cached success. Create a new session to recover.
Synchronous calls run one at a time and block the calling Node.js thread.
An active call cannot be canceled.
The session extracts facts and disposes of the corresponding snapshot.
It retains the compiler connection for other configurations and the facts for repeated tasks.
Cached requests do not contact the compiler and cannot detect a compiler-process failure.

Failure diagnostics describe only user-caused issues, including invalid input, configuration, and caller actions.
Use the public `DiagnosticCode` definition for code meanings and corrective actions.
Internal-only validation uses standard assertions. Assertion failures and unexpected operational errors propagate as exceptions, not diagnostics.
Capability limitations can accompany successful facts; they are not user-input failures.

Facts retain exported names separately from declaration identifiers.
They also retain type-only export paths, namespace exports, merged declarations, effective members, and individual call signatures.
Use portable data without compiler handles. Report limitations when a representation is incomplete.
Identifiers are provisional and must not use compiler handle numbers or traversal order.
The Stage 1 representation is not yet a versioned documentation model or a complete API reference graph.

## Release classification and selection contract

The first Stage 2 increment classifies identified documentation inputs and selects metadata views.
It does not generate reports, validate semantic references, or trim declaration text.
`classifyApiItems` accepts items with `id` and `documentation` fields, including callable signature facts.
The required `documentation` property has type `string | undefined`.
Supply only the associated TSDoc comment, including delimiters, or `undefined` when no comment exists.
An explicit empty comment such as `/** */` is present documentation. An empty string is invalid comment text, not an absent comment.
Do not supply declaration text in this field.
This distinction supports the future inheritance rule: absence permits automatic inheritance, while any local TSDoc comment suppresses it.
Classification does not implement inheritance and does not preserve raw comments in its metadata output; retain the original facts for that work.
Each item is classified independently. Callers supply callable overloads, not implementation signatures.
The result contains each item's identifier, release level, and modifier tags, sorted by identifier.
Duplicate identifiers fail with `classification-duplicate-id`; this API does not resolve provisional identity collisions.

Use `@microsoft/tsdoc` to parse comments. Do not interpret tags with a custom comment parser.
`ReleaseLevel` is a numeric enum: `Public = 0`, `Beta = 1`, `Alpha = 2`, and `Internal = 3`.
Increasing values express increasing permissiveness. Numeric comparison is intentional API behavior.
TSDoc tags remain `@public`, `@beta`, `@alpha`, and `@internal`, with an explicit mapping to enum values.
Classification metadata, including its JSON representation, stores numeric release levels instead of strings.
Custom modifier names are supplied explicitly in `customModifierTags`, with a leading `@`.
Names must not redefine standard tags or each other. Filters use the configured spelling.
No Fluid-specific tags or surface names are built in.
TSDoc parser diagnostics fail classification by default. Set `rules.validateTsdocSyntax` to `false` to suppress those diagnostics.
For example, an unconfigured tag or malformed inline tag produces a parser diagnostic.
Disabling this rule does not disable parsing: recognized tags still contribute to classification.
Missing-release checks remain controlled by `rules.requireReleaseLevel`, and conflicting release levels always fail.
Absent documentation bypasses comment parsing. An explicit empty TSDoc comment parses successfully.
Both lack release tags and produce the same missing-release diagnostic when that rule is enabled.
Invalid supplied strings, including empty strings, produce parser diagnostics unless `rules.validateTsdocSyntax` is disabled.
Missing release levels fail by default. Set `rules.requireReleaseLevel` to `false` to retain untagged items with an `undefined` release level.
JSON serialization omits `releaseLevel` for untagged items. Reading an omitted field returns `undefined`.
Check absence explicitly: `ReleaseLevel.Public` is zero, not an absent release level.
Multiple distinct release levels on one item always fail with `classification-release-conflict` because selection would be ambiguous.
Mixed release levels across different overloads are valid, including mixed internal and non-internal overloads.
Failures contain diagnostics and no partial classification. Diagnostic messages identify the affected item.
Invalid tag configuration fails with `classification-configuration`.

`selectApiItems` accepts classified metadata and a named selection.
`releaseLevels` is an explicit set, not a release-order threshold. Internal items appear only when explicitly selected.
`includeUntagged` defaults to `false`.
All `requireTags` must be present, and none of the `excludeTags` may be present.
Both tag lists default to empty. Unknown or unconfigured filter tags fail with `selection-configuration`.
An empty selection name or an unsupported release level also fails with `selection-configuration`.
A successful selection contains its name and matching metadata items, sorted by identifier.
Classification and selection do not mutate or freeze caller-owned inputs. Their results are deeply frozen.
They perform no compiler queries, filesystem access, baseline updates, or artifact writes.
The original analysis facts remain available for later validation, including validation of excluded targets.
Full declaration selection and reference validation require later contracts and tests.
Classification options are explicit inputs to this API, not values read from the analysis session's rule map.
Reuse a successful classification for several selections. The classifier does not cache or automatically repeat this work for each selection.

The following example classifies two overloads and selects the public partner metadata without including the internal overload:

```typescript
import { classifyApiItems, ReleaseLevel, selectApiItems } from "api-analyzer";

const classified = classifyApiItems(
	[
		{ id: "convert:text", documentation: "/** @public @partner */" },
		{ id: "convert:number", documentation: "/** @internal @partner */" },
	],
	{ customModifierTags: ["@partner"] },
);
if (!classified.ok) {
	throw new Error(JSON.stringify(classified.diagnostics));
}
const selected = selectApiItems(classified.value, {
	name: "partner-public",
	releaseLevels: [ReleaseLevel.Public],
	requireTags: ["@partner"],
});
if (!selected.ok) {
	throw new Error(JSON.stringify(selected.diagnostics));
}
console.log(selected.value.items); // Contains metadata for convert:text only.
```

## Review artifacts and baselines

Review artifacts must identify the package and configured surface. Their API content must expose exported names,
type-only export paths, callable signatures, release levels, and policy-relevant modifiers.
Generation must use deterministic ordering and exclude volatile data such as timestamps and absolute checkout paths.
Separate selections must produce separate artifacts from shared analysis. Baseline comparison must not trigger analysis.
The declaration renderer and its exact report syntax are not yet implemented or stabilized.
Raw declaration text is not a substitute for correctly selected declarations, and metadata-only output is not a complete API report.

The initial baseline API accepts generated report text without interpreting its syntax.
`compareReviewBaseline(actual, expected)` performs a pure, exact string comparison.
An `undefined` expected value means that no accepted baseline exists; an empty string is an existing empty baseline.
Missing and stale baselines return `baseline-missing` and `baseline-stale` diagnostics respectively.
Neither case contains a partial success value or accepts the generated text.
Line endings, whitespace, and the final newline are significant. Deterministic report generation must normalize its own output.

`checkReviewBaseline(actual, baselinePath)` reads a UTF-8 baseline and performs the same comparison without writing.
Only a missing file is converted to a missing-baseline diagnostic. Other filesystem errors propagate as exceptions.
`updateReviewBaseline(actual, baselinePath)` explicitly writes the supplied text as UTF-8, creating or replacing the file.
The caller must provide an absolute path and an existing parent directory. Invalid relative paths return a configuration diagnostic.
Update errors propagate as exceptions. Updates are single-file writes, not transactions across multiple artifacts.
Call update only after generation and all required validation and parity checks succeed.
The library does not implicitly create directories or accept a baseline when checking it.

Compare two generated surface texts directly to check parity without writing either text to an accepted baseline.
The caller must use the same review identity and rendering options for both surfaces.
This increment establishes baseline handling only; it does not satisfy the Stage 2 review-output or parity gates.

## Experimental API

The following example resolves configuration and reuses one analysis result for several consumers.
The configured project must include the declaration entrypoint and its dependencies.
All relative configuration paths use the supplied working directory, including paths inherited from base configurations.

```typescript
import { createAnalysisSession, resolveConfiguration } from "api-analyzer";

const resolved = resolveConfiguration(
	{
		packageName: "example-package",
		project: "tsconfig.api.json",
		entrypoints: [{ name: ".", path: "lib/index.d.ts" }],
		rules: { documentation: false },
	},
	process.cwd(),
);

if (!resolved.ok) {
	throw new Error(JSON.stringify(resolved.diagnostics));
}

const session = createAnalysisSession();
try {
	const first = session.analyze(resolved.value);
	if (!first.ok) {
		throw new Error(JSON.stringify(first.diagnostics));
	}

	// Consumers share frozen facts without retaining compiler handles.
	console.log(first.value.surfaces);
	console.log(first.value.declarations);
	const repeated = session.analyze(resolved.value);
	console.log(repeated.ok && repeated.value === first.value);

	// Call this after a relevant file, dependency, or configuration change.
	session.invalidate();
} finally {
	session.close();
}
```

`resolveConfiguration` returns structured diagnostics for missing settings, invalid entrypoints, duplicate names, and inheritance cycles.
`packageRoot` defaults to the supplied working directory.
Supplied arrays replace inherited arrays. Rule maps merge by key.
An explicit `false` rule value overrides an inherited `true`.
You can inspect rule settings at this stage, but the analyzer does not execute the rules.
Compiler options and module resolution conditions come from the selected TypeScript project.
Use separate project configurations for different conditions.

`analyze` returns deeply frozen facts or diagnostics. Compiler diagnostic failures do not produce partial success.
Entrypoint order and changes to rule settings do not invalidate facts.
Changing the configured set of entrypoints creates a separate cache entry.
`invalidate` discards all cached facts and closes the current compiler connection.
The next request creates a new compiler connection.
Repeated `close` calls have no effect. Later analysis requests return `session-closed`.
`getStatistics` returns the counts of adapter analysis calls, cache hits, and invalidation calls made while the session was open.
Analysis calls that fail still contribute to the analysis count.
The counters do not measure compiler-internal work and are not reset by invalidation or close.

Declaration and signature identities are provisional. Tests cover separate aliases, namespaces, merged declarations, overload reordering, and checkout relocation.
They do not establish a complete identity scheme for multiple installed versions of the same package or every anonymous and computed declaration.
Member facts preserve effective type text, optional and readonly state, and declaration locations.
Incomplete member expansion produces `partial` and diagnostics while preserving the original declaration text.
Signature documentation contains only the closest compiler-attached TSDoc comment, including delimiters, or `undefined` when absent.
Ordinary comments do not count as TSDoc. Explicit empty TSDoc comments remain present.
The enclosing declaration fact retains full source declaration text separately; signature `text` retains the printed function type.
JSON serialization omits `undefined` documentation fields. Reading an omitted field returns `undefined`, while explicit empty comment strings remain intact.
These comments are not parsed or resolved documentation models.
Construct signatures, structured index signatures, and a complete graph of referenced types are not part of this initial fact format.

## Commands

Run these commands from this package directory to install pinned dependencies and execute the investigation:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test:contracts
pnpm check:format
```

The package has an independent workspace and lockfile so it does not change the client release group's compiler.
The test build uses TS7. TS6 is a fixture-build and consumer-check dependency only, not an analysis fallback.
Run `pnpm test` to include all Stage 0 investigation gates as well. That command intentionally remains unsuccessful while the three recorded gates fail.
`test:contracts` runs the analysis and configuration contracts plus release-classification and metadata-selection tests.
`test:stage1` retains its existing command name and selects the `Effective configuration`, `Analysis session`, and `Adapter fact extraction` suites, plus session-lifecycle worker tests.
Test names describe behavior. Applicable design identifiers appear in comments above tests.
Temporary investigation tests have comments that explain their purpose and when to remove or replace them.
The focused command is not a claim that the excluded gates pass.

## Stage 0 results

Verified on 2026-09-15 in the Linux codespace after restarting the interrupted session.
The package build and `pnpm check:format` pass.
At the end of Stage 0, `pnpm test` reported **19 passing tests and 3 failing tests** and exited unsuccessfully.
The failures remain active capability gates. Do not treat this package as ready for production integration or add its test command to required repository CI without resolving their disposition.

The analysis engine is TS7 7.0.2. Input builds use TS6 6.0.3 and TS7 7.0.2.
The package remains private with an independent lockfile; this does not resolve the publication decision.

### Verified capabilities

The [native capability tests](src/test/nativeCapabilities.test.ts) run the same assertions against declarations built with both compiler versions.
They verify:

- Declaration inputs have no syntactic, semantic, or program diagnostics for the small fixture.
- Public aliases retain their names and share the expected target identity. Export syntax distinguishes type-only paths.
- Generic class and interface members specialize to the expected consumer type.
- Ordinary intersections and the tested combinations of `Pick`, `Omit`, and `Readonly` expose the expected members.
- Public type-node conversion exposes effective readonly and optional modifiers.
- Two callable overloads retain their separate comments and release tags after declaration emit.
- Printing the existing complete declaration files produces output that compiles with both consumer compilers. This covers all four input-build and consumer-compiler combinations.
- A repeated export lookup returns the same cached result with zero recorded compiler requests. Several semantic queries use the same retained snapshot and project.

The [lifecycle tests](src/test/lifecycle.test.ts) and [worker](src/test/lifecycleWorker.ts) also verify synchronous and asynchronous normal disposal in bounded Linux worker processes.
The synchronous client passes a source-based semantic query, cached lookup, snapshot-disposal checks, and a native-process termination probe.
The harness terminates the worker process group during cleanup, including after a failed test.

### Blockers and limits

| Finding | Evidence | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No retained-program declaration emission in the tested API | The `retained Program exposes declaration emission` test fails for each input compiler because the program exposes neither `emit` nor `getDeclarationEmit`. Its comment identifies it as a temporary W5 capability probe. | Review the generation strategy before production implementation. This is a missing capability in the tested approach, not proof that W5 is impossible through every public API. |
| Async request does not settle after native termination | The async crash worker exits with code 13 and an unsettled top-level await at `assert.rejects(api.getTimingInfo())`. | Do not select the async client without resolving or containing this failure through an approved design. The test does not establish the behavior of every operation or failure mode. |
| Reuse evidence is narrow | A cached export query records zero requests; related queries retain their snapshot. | This does not measure compiler-wide recomputation or prove reuse across implemented reports, validation, models, and declarations. Those tasks do not exist yet. |
| Generation evidence is narrow | Existing declaration source files are printed and consumed successfully. Fixture declaration builds invoke the compiler CLI separately. | Neither operation proves trimmed rollups, dependency inclusion, import cleanup, or generation from retained semantic analysis. |
| Lifecycle evidence is platform-specific | Process checks use Linux `/proc` and process groups. | Windows and macOS lifecycle behavior is unverified. Test cleanup is not a production lifecycle implementation. |

At the end of Stage 0, the full semantic fixture suite used the async client and the synchronous client had only the smaller comparison described above.
Stage 1 reran the full fixture suite through the synchronous client before using it for the experimental session.
The async crash reproduction remains separate and unresolved.

No full W/F/B requirement is closed by this investigation.
Cross-package documentation resolution, custom policy, release filtering, stable artifact identities, invalidation, cancellation, and representative repository packages remain untested.
No production analyzer API, custom compiler bridge, compiler patch, or migration was added.

### Review decisions

1. **Declaration generation:** Decide whether to evaluate a newer published TS7 API or an existing compatible generation component. Preserve the shared-analysis requirement. Do not assume development-only emit APIs are released or silently use TS6 analysis.
2. **Client selection:** Consider the synchronous client for the next stage, then run the full semantic suite through it and document blocking, cancellation, and crash behavior before approval.
3. **Capability gate handling:** Keep the reproductions visible. Decide how to separate investigation gates from a future required production test suite without representing unresolved capabilities as passing.
4. **Upstream follow-up:** Confirm current upstream coverage for both findings and record exact issue links before filing a new report. This resumed verification has not established those links or filed issues.

Stage 0 has produced a scaffold and reproducible capability evidence, including failed gates.
The declaration-generation strategy and upstream reproductions remain open follow-ups. Stage 1 proceeds independently of those generation gates.

## Stage 1 results

Verified on 2026-09-15: all 29 tests selected by `pnpm test:stage1` pass as part of `pnpm test:contracts`.
The build and formatter pass.
The earlier full `pnpm test` run reported 34 passing tests and the same 3 unresolved Stage 0 failures.
That full-suite count predates the additional configuration and extraction-helper tests.
The full suite was not rerun for the helper extraction refactor or the test-name changes.

The [configuration tests](src/test/configuration.test.ts), [session tests](src/test/session.test.ts), [native capability tests](src/test/nativeCapabilities.test.ts), and [lifecycle tests](src/test/lifecycle.test.ts) cover the initial contracts.
They verify ordered configuration inheritance, immutable effective settings, shared frozen facts, explicit invalidation, and failure handling.
The session analyzes declarations built with TS6 6.0.3 and TS7 7.0.2 through TS7 7.0.2.
The full synchronous semantic suite also passes the original semantic and printing checks; the missing emit-method gates still fail.

Additional tests verify chained type-only exports, namespace and merged declaration facts, effective members, separate overload identities, and explicit incomplete expansion.
Node and browser dependency fixtures retain their distinct types and package origins.
Tests verify fresh-session agreement after dependency changes and identical facts after checkout relocation.
Linux worker tests verify session disposal and that the session remains closed after it detects a compiler-process failure.

The adapter's extraction helpers are module-level functions with explicit dependencies.
They are exported from the internal adapter module for tests, not from the package entrypoint.
Each extraction owns its package-location cache and declaration tracking state.
Compiler-dependent helper tests use the existing real-compiler fixtures instead of compiler mocks.
Direct tests cover package locations, aliases, type-only exports, members, signatures, and declaration collection.
They also check cache separation, repeated collection, and the active-identifier guard.

The Stage 1 implementation uses pure configuration and immutable data, with native communication, filesystem access, and caches isolated in the adapter and session.
It does not close the full W/F/B requirements or resolve the Stage 0 declaration-generation limitation.

## Initial Stage 2 results

Verified on 2026-09-15: `pnpm test:contracts` passes 45 tests.
This includes 29 analysis and configuration contracts, 12 [classification and selection tests](src/test/classification.test.ts), and four real-compiler integration cases.
Tests distinguish absent, ordinary, explicit empty, and tagged comments through source analysis and TS6/TS7 declaration emit.
They preserve that distinction after session closure and JSON serialization, and verify that documentation excludes declaration text.
Tests fix the numeric release-level ordering and verify that selections remain explicit sets rather than thresholds.
The new contract tests first failed against implementation stubs, then passed after implementation.
The integration cases classify and select detached callable overload facts after the analysis session closes, using declarations built with TS6 and TS7.
They check that the untagged implementation signature is absent, the public selection excludes the internal overload, and the original facts remain unchanged.

The classifier uses pinned `@microsoft/tsdoc` 0.16.0 from the Microsoft TSDoc project, under the MIT license.
The dependency is installed only in this package's independent workspace.
Classification and selection return frozen metadata without compiler objects. They do not construct review artifacts or alter declaration text.
The subsequent baseline-handling increment implements comparison and explicit updates as described below.
Structured reference facts, cross-package validation, review generation, and the repository pilot remain open Stage 2 work.
The full compiler investigation suite was not rerun for this increment. Its recorded failures remain unresolved, and no full W/F/B entry is closed.

### Baseline handling increment

Verified on 2026-09-15: `pnpm test:contracts` passes 48 tests. The build, formatting, and whitespace checks pass.
The [baseline tests](src/test/reviewBaseline.test.ts) add three acceptance cases to `test:contracts`.
They check exact comparison, absent versus empty baselines, read-only checks, explicit creation and replacement,
relative-path diagnostics, and propagation of unexpected filesystem errors.
The tests first failed because the public baseline APIs were absent, then passed after implementation.
This increment does not generate reports or validate declaration references. It establishes the independent baseline boundary for the next report-generation work.
